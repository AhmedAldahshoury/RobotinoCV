notes:


1) number of positive samples should related be to negative around 2:1 (positive samples should be more

2) The precision of your cascade is shown by acceptanceRatio on the last stage it should be around this value 0.000412662 or less.
    But if you get acceptanceRatio like this 7.83885e-07 your cascade is probably overtrained and it wont find anything, try to set less stages.
